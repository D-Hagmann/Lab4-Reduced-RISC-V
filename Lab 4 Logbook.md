## Role allocation

There are 4 tasks which need to be implemented: 

1. Program Counter and related adders.
2. The Register File, ALU and the relatedÂ [MUX](https://github.com/aw-999/Lab4-Reduced-RISC-V/blob/main/repo/rtl/mux.sv).
3. The Control Unit, the Sign-extension Unit and the instruction memory.
4. The testbench and verification of the whole design working via gtkWave and Vbuddy (where appropriate).
